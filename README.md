# Time Series Analysis with Stock Price Data

## Overview
Understanding stock price behavior is a cornerstone of financial analysis. With this project, we dive into historical stock price data to reveal patterns, trends, and anomalies that influence market dynamics. Using time series analysis techniques, this project serves as a practical exploration of financial data, paving the way for insightful analyses and future predictions.

## Objectives
This project focuses on achieving the following:
- **Uncover Trends:** Identify long-term movements and short-term fluctuations in stock prices.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Examine seasonality, autocorrelation, and stationarity in stock price metrics.
- **Relationships:** Analyze correlations between stock price variables and trading volumes.
- **Visualization:** Utilize advanced charts to enhance data storytelling.
- **Smoothing Techniques:** Apply rolling averages to filter noise and highlight trends.

## Dataset Description
The dataset, `stock_data.csv`, captures critical details about stock performance over time:
- **Date:** The trading day.
- **Open:** Opening price of the stock.
- **High:** Highest trading price on the day.
- **Low:** Lowest trading price on the day.
- **Close:** Closing price of the stock.
- **Volume:** Number of shares traded.
- **Name:** Stock ticker symbol.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess raw stock data for effective time series analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and explore stock price behavior over time.
- **Statistical Insights:** Leverage techniques like autocorrelation and seasonal decomposition to identify underlying patterns.
- **Dynamic Smoothing:** Introduce rolling averages to smooth data and observe trends with clarity.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## How to Get Started
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rushi2810/Time-Series-Analysis-with-Stock-Price-Data.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Move into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Time-Series-Analysis-with-Stock-Price-Data
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```

## Highlights of the Analysis
- **Trend Analysis:** Detailed line charts to track stock price movements over time.
- **Correlation Heatmaps:** Explore relationships between metrics like `Open`, `Close`, and `Volume`.
- **Seasonal Decomposition:** Break down stock prices into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
- **Autocorrelation Function (ACF):** Visualize dependencies in trading volumes and identify lagged relationships.

## Next Steps
This project is a stepping stone for further financial analysis. Future enhancements could include:
1. **Predictive Models:** Build ARIMA or LSTM models for stock price forecasting.
2. **Comparative Studies:** Analyze multiple stock datasets to uncover sector-level trends.
3. **Event-Based Insights:** Examine how key market events affect stock prices.
